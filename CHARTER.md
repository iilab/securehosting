Secure Hosting Coalition - Charter
==================================

Purpose
-------

This charter establishes a coalition of secure hosting providers who share a joint vision transparency, standards and collaboration for the protection of users. The coalition specifically works to protect high-risk users like human rights defenders, journalists, activists, and civil society organisations who depend on secure hosting services to fulfill their mission and conduct their operations in hostile information environments.

This charter is accompanied by ongoing work that:
 - defines technical and behavioral standards for secure hosting in different risk conditions
 - defines strategic goals, means and approaches
 - defines a governance structure for the coalition
 - provides active risk and service provision peer evaluations and standards for such

It is a voluntary code, enforced by the will of the organisation accepting it to maintain the standards laid down in the Charter. Attached to it are two annexes, describing the working environment that we would like to see created by Intermediary and Donor Organisations in order to facilitate the effective delivery of Secure Hosting provision.

Secure Hosting is one hub but there are a number of other services that are critical to guarantee the security of users. By establishing standards within the Secure Hosting Providers field, we also urge other fields (Education, Support, Rapid Response, Web Development,...) to establish standards relevant to operations in high risk environments.
Principles
We support individuals and organisations in exercising their basic human rights on the Internet by protecting their right to free speech, right to access information, right to privacy and freedom of assembly.

We seek to put in place measurable efforts to protect our users, our user's data and the availability of our user's data against common attacks

We commit to use standard risk evaluation methods and design and implement secure hosting services that are commensurate to the user's risks, skills, communities. We aim to protect our users from the negative consequences directly related to the use of our services, by putting in place reasonable efforts to understand their risk profile, skill level, operations and adversaries. 

We will seek to obtain properly informed consent and to respect our user's privacy or anonymity. We will recommend or provide education when necessary to allow users to have the necessary skills to use their services in a safe and secure manner.

We will never knowingly – or through negligence – allow ourselves, or our employees, to be used to gather information of a political, [TL add social - to include social networks information] military or economically sensitive nature for governments or other bodies that may serve purposes other than those which are strictly humanitarian, nor will we act as instruments of foreign policy of donor [TL companies/individuals… will just leave donors] governments. We will use the assistance we receive to respond to needs and this assistance should not be driven by the need to dispose of donor commodity surpluses, nor by the political interest of any particular 
donor. We value and promote the voluntary giving of labour and finances by concerned individuals to support our work and recognise the independence of action promoted by such voluntary motivation. In order to protect our independence we will seek to avoid dependence upon a single funding source. 

We're aligned with:
 - APC Internet Rights Charter
 - UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 
 - EU/US Directives on Data Protection / Canadians and Australians.

Commitments
-----------

1. Transparency
---------------

We recognise that secure hosting provision is a complex set of practices and technologies, Secure Hosting Providers will communicate the scope of their services to their users and partners, their adoption of standards and best practices. Users have the right to know.

We will keep our users informed about evolving risks, integrity of their data and attacks they are subject to. We will seek to respond to our user's questions in a timely manner and to develop partnerships that can help support our capacity to communicate in local languages and recommend other providers of services or resources.

  * We agree to transparently communicate how fit our services are to cater to different risk profiles of users. We agree not to hide or misrepresent our capabilities to service high risk users to users, intermediaries, donors.
  * We will communicate how, when and why we need to comply to legal requests (take down etc.), and what the procedures are.

2. Standards

We believe that building standards in the field is critical to allow practices to be measured and provide reliability and predictability for the users of secure hosting services. We believe that standards will help webmasters and the organisations that support them to make better decisions with regards to the security of their hosting. It will help differentiate secure hosting providers based on objective criteria and their fitness to operate within medium or high risk environments. It will set standards for vendors and funders to push forward industry best practices.

3. Collaboration

With a constantly evolving landscape of technological practices and threats, Secure Hosting Providers will seek to maintain the quality of their technological approaches and engage with their peers by participating in knowledge exchange, communities of practices, adopting standards or seek to implement the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

 - Hold each other to account
 - We agree to share about our good practices, bad practices.
